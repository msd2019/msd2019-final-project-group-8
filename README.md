This repository has code to attempt to replicate and extend the results in Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language by Thomas Davidson, Dana Warmsley, Michael Macy, Ingmar Weber4 Published in ICWSM 2017.

You can find the Shiny app here :  https://ankitpeshin.shinyapps.io/Twitter-wordvec/

A complete report of our results is in `05_final_report.pdf`, which can be generated by cloning this repository and running `make` to execute the commands in the `Makefile` file. All data are in `data/` and any original source code provided by the authors is in `authors_original_code/`.

The repository is structured as follows:

1. `01_get_original_data.sh` gets the original data used by the authors and places a copy in `data/`

2. `extension/` folder contains all our code files that were used to implement and extend the author's work. The app.R and twitter_vector.Rmd are the files for our app and will allow you to replicate the app. 

2. `05_final_report.Rmd` analysis both the original and new data to replicate and extend the results of the original paper, and produces the final report `05_final_report.pdf`

Notes:

The exact structure of the repository may vary from group to group. For instance, you might have a different number of files, some might be `.R` scripts instead of `.sh` scripts, etc., but follow the basic template and edit this README accordingly so that others can run your code and reproduce _your_ results with one command that executes your entire analysis from start to a finished report. You don't necessarily have to use make for your "run all" command, but it can be quite helpful, especially if the process of getting or cleaning the data takes much longer than running the final analysis and generating the report. Whatever the "run all" command is, it should be clearly noted so that others know what it is and how to execute it. If the data files you are using are small enough, add a copy directly to your repository. If a file is too large to add to the repository, include a URL that points to a copy of the data so that others can access it. 

(Delete these notes in your copy of the repository.)
